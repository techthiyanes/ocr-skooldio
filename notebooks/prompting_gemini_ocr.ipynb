      "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's the breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Sunlight is made up of all colors of the rainbow.**  This is called the visible light spectrum.\n",
      "* **When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with the tiny molecules of air.** These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.\n",
      "* **This interaction causes the light to scatter in all directions.** This scattering is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths of light, like blue and violet.\n",
      "* **Blue light is scattered more than other colors because it has a shorter wavelength.** This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Here's a simple analogy:** Imagine shining a flashlight through a glass of milk. The light scatters and the milk appears white. Similarly, sunlight scatters off the air molecules, making the sky appear blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why isn't the sky violet?**\n",
      "\n",
      "While violet light is scattered even more than blue, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light. Therefore, we perceive the sky as blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Other factors that affect the color of the sky:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Time of day:** The sky appears more vibrant blue at noon when the sun is high in the sky. At sunrise and sunset, the light travels through more air, scattering more blue light, and leaving behind the longer wavelengths, which appear red and orange.\n",
      "* **Clouds:** Clouds reflect sunlight, making the sky appear white or gray.\n",
      "* **Pollution:** Air pollution can also affect the color of the sky, making it appear hazy or even reddish.\n",
